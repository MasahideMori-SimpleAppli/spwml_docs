Summary
===============

A block that allows you to create a drop-down button.

It is necessary to set the SID.

This is a flavor of dropdownBtn that allows state management via a String.

It requires SIDs for all children, but in some cases it can be more convenient than the plain version because the state can be managed via SIDs.

It has not only `DropdownButton class <https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DropdownButton-class.html>`__ variables that has variables that have been further adjusted to improve usability.

To use this type, it is necessary to set `SelectionManager <https://pub.dev/packages/simple_managers>`__  to SpWMLBuilder or SpWML widget.
