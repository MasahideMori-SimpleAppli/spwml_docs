Summary
===============

A block that allows you to create a popup menu.

It is necessary to set the SID.

This is a flavor of popupMenuBtn that allows state management via a String.

It requires SIDs for all children, but in some cases it can be more convenient than the plain version because the state can be managed via SIDs.

It has not only `PopupMenuButton class <https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/PopupMenuButton-class.html>`__ variables that has variables that have been further adjusted to improve usability.

To use this type, it is necessary to set `SelectionManager <https://pub.dev/packages/simple_managers>`__  to SpWMLBuilder or SpWML widget.
