How to write by SpWML
========================

.. code-block:: none
   
   (segmentedBtn2, sid:segmentedBtn1)
   +(menu, tag:child1)button1
   +(menu, tag:child2)button2
   +(menu, tag:child3)button3

Summary
===============

A block that allows you to create buttons separated by fields.

It is necessary to set the SID.

This is a flavor of segmentedBtn that allows state management via a String.

It requires tags for all children, but in some cases it can be more convenient than the plain version because the state can be managed via tags.

It has a variable with parameters equivalent to Flutter `SegmentedButton class <https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SegmentedButton-class.html>`__ .

To use this type, it is necessary to set `MultiTagSelectionManager <https://pub.dev/packages/simple_managers>`__  to SpWMLBuilder or SpWML widget.
