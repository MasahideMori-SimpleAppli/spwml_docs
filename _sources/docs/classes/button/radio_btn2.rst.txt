How to write by SpWML
========================

.. code-block:: none
   
   (radioBtn2, sid:rBtn1)
   +(menu, tag:child1)menu 1
   +(menu, tag:child2)menu 2
   +(menu, tag:child3)menu 3

----

Summary
===============

A block that can create radio buttons.

It is necessary to set the SID.

This is a flavor of radioBtn that allows state management via a String.

It requires tags for all children, but in some cases it can be more convenient than the plain version because the state can be managed via tags.

It has not only `Radio class <https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Radio-class.html>`__ variables that has variables that have been further adjusted to improve usability.

To use this type, it is necessary to set `TagSelectionManager <https://pub.dev/packages/simple_managers>`__  to SpWMLBuilder or SpWML widget.
