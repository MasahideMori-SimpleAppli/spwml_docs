SpWML Parameters
====================

* :ref:`The common<spwml>` parameters.
* type (String). Specifies the resource loading source. Specify either network, asset, or memory. If it is memory and ImgParams.bytes is null, it works as network. In the case of the network, if you give a URL, the image will be downloaded and displayed from there, but be careful about CORS. The default is the network type.
* fit (String). Specifies how the image fits within this element. It can be none, contain, cover, fitHeight, or fitWidth.
* repeat (String).Set whether to repeat the image. Specify one of noRepeat, repeat, repeatX, or repeatY. The "repeat" repeats in both vertical and horizontal directions, "repeatX" only in the X-axis direction, and "repeatY" only in the Y-axis direction.
* clipType (String). Specifies image clipping. Specify one of none, oval, rRect. Default is none.
* clipRadius (double). Specifies the radius of rounding applied when clipType is rRect.
