What is SpWML?
======================================

A markup language for Flutter
===============================
SpWML is an open source markup language for Flutter applications.

SpWML has the following features:

* Since the contents are described in units of lines, it is easy to reuse parts and port only parameters.
* If there is a problem with the description, it will tell you which line is wrong, except for crashing the app due to a runtime error.
* Design and logic can be separated cleanly, so you can create from any screen. It will be easier to create a screen after login or after linking with the server.
* The number of lines on the program code side becomes considerably shorter, making maintenance easier.
* Most parameters can be changed directly from Dart.

The source code of SpWML is published in the following repositories.

What SpWML aims for
=======================
SpWML aims to create "Program UI" "quickly" and "with high maintainability".
Therefore, it is particularly suitable for cases such as:

* New app development of ventures and startups with fast development speed and frequent updates.
* MVP prototyping and experimental projects.
* Development of business system.
* Development of programs using AI.

By using SpWML, you can not only build quickly, but also make it difficult to create spaghetti code.
By limiting the degree of freedom, it is less likely that the code will become obscure after the person in charge takes over.

In this way, SpWML is being developed with business practicality as the top priority.

In addition, as the direction of SpWML, the description method including parameters may differ from pure Flutter code.
If you're thinking of building a completely compatible and static layout, you should look for another project.
There are other projects trying to do this with XML and markdown.

SpWML is being developed in the direction of "making it easier to write a practical layout with a small amount of code".
Also, recently (as of 2023), it has become possible to create programs from AI, so we are also optimizing for such usage.
