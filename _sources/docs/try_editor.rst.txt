Try SpWML Editor!
======================================

There is a simple editor written in SpWML, so please try various things.

This is a simple build for test display,
so I think the best way to use it is to paste code created with another code editor to test and fine-tune the UI.

SpWML notation
====================
SpWML is structured as a derivative of SpBML.
`Simple Block Markup Laungage(SpBML) <https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/simple_block_markup_language/>`__ 

.. code-block:: none
   
   (type, parameter1:value1, parameter2:value2,...)content

If SpBML is XML, SpWML is like HTML, and SpBML is a more flexible language.
The writing method is the same as SpBML, and type names such as h1 and h2, which are similar to HTML, are predefined.

For example, if you want to write text in the size of header 1, do the following.

.. code-block:: none
   
   (h1)The text

Available parameters differ depending on the type.
Please refer to :ref:`Classes and methods<classes_and_methods>` on this homepage for detailed type names and available parameters.
